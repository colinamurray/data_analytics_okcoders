# In-Class Exercises


# Factors ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

colors <- c("blue", "green", "blue", "red", "red", "orange", NA, "red", "blue")

# How many total elements are there to the colors vector?


# Turn colors into a factor and print the structure to see how many levels it contains.



# Indexing -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

data <- c(103, 44, 11, 14, 65, NA, 44, 17, 44, 99, -4, -209)

# Add together the 3rd element and the 7th element of the data.


# Subset the data to include only values that are greater than 29.


# Make a new version of the data where the NA value no longer exists.


# Give me the sum of the 5th to 9th values of the data



# Combining Functions ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How many values in the data are less than 51


# Multiply all values in the data less than 25 by 99, and get the sum.


# What is the sum of the natural logs of all values in the data equal to or greater than the median?


# What percentage of the data is lower than the average?
