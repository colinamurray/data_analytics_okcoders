## Spring 2017 Data Analytics
Notes, Code Samples, Exercises, and Project Instructions for the [OU-CCEW OKCoders Data Analytics Boot Camp](http://okcoders.com/uncategorized/data-analytics-bootcamp-announced-for-spring-2018-in-okc/).


### Scope of the Course
This 8-week introductory bootcamp will cover the basics of data analytics using R and SQL. During the 8 weeks youâ€™ll learn how to work with a relational SQL database, how to break down analytical questions into small sub-problems, and how to solve each with the R programming language. The class will cover the basics of working with data, statistical modeling, and some application of machine learning. This will include the completion of 2 analytical projects that can be shown in a code portfolio. The bootcamp is intended for beginners, but experienced developers are welcome as well.


### Technology Used in this Course
+ [R Programming Language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html): This is a very popular programming language that is optimized for data analysis and very easy to understand. Lots of popular data analytics and data science platforms make first class use of R functionality. Additionally, R has a very active community of developers that have built freely available packages to do very powerful things right out of the box.
+ [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/): This is what is called an IDE: an Integrated Development Environment. This is not only where you will write your code, it how you will run it and inspect what is going on while you are building your functionality. IDE's give you a ton of added functionality to make writing, testing, and working with your code much, much easier. RStudio is an incredibly powerful tool and hopefully will become a first class citizen of your analytics toolbox.
+ [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL): The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the primary method for interacting with [Relational Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database). A Relational Database is a place to house data that neatly fits into rows and columns (think Excel, but far more powerful and scalable). We will use SQL to interact with data, do simple data connection and formatting operations, and even interact with SQL from inside the analytics pipelines we will write in R.


### Datasets Used in this Course
The datasets we will use will be composed of several different formats. Some you will have access to directly and will be posted here alongside the code samples. Some will be housed in a database you will be given access to. At the moment, those details are still being finalized, so please stay tuned to updates on this page for more in-depth descriptions of the datasets that will be used.


### Projects
The details of the projects that we will build are still being finalized, please stay tuned as this page updates closer to the beginning of class.


### Additional Helpful Resources
There are a ton of resources out there to learn data analytics, machine learning, and data science. Some are great, some are crap, and most are in the middle somewhere. These are the ones that I find to be the best place to get started and learn a ton. Almost everything here is free or has a free version with a premium for additional help/coaching.
+ [TryR](http://tryr.codeschool.com/): We will actually use this resource right in class, but it is great to come back to at other times or to start with before class even begins to keep your R programming skills sharp. It's well designed, completely interactive, free, and runs right in your browser so you can learn elementary R programming without having to download anything.
+ [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/): Of all the online interactive education platforms that teach technical skills, I find Udacity to be the far and away best. While many models seek to scale up the "college class" idea, Udacity built a platform that more simulates a personal tutor. You are required to actually answer questions and program solutions to be able to move ahead, and you can take as much time or as little as needed until you master a concept. Browse either their nanodegree concepts (which have paid elements), or look into their course catalog directly to learn anything you want to. If you are a little rusty on statistics, I would highly recommend their statistics courses; as well as their Machine Learning units.
+ [The Open Source Data Science Masters](http://datasciencemasters.org/): As you complete the basics of this course, if you want to go into Data Science--this is a fantastic place to look around. This is like a meta-index of the best (and almost all free) resources on the internet to teach you different Data Science skills.

### Environment Setup
We will go over this in class, so don't feel too much pressure to have this done before coming. But if you can, please go ahead and set up the main components on your machine to ensure we move along speedily.

#### R
+ Please go to the [R Download Site](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/) and download the Mac/Windows version as applicable to your machine. The installation instructions are right there on the site, but the installation should be minimal effort. Please make sure you do this first before attempting to download or install RStudio.
+ Please go to the [RStudio Download Site](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and download the "Installer for Supported Platforms" version that corresponds to your machine.

#### SQL
+ Please revisit this site as we determine what will be our solution to the software you will need to best interact with the SQL databases we intend to use.
